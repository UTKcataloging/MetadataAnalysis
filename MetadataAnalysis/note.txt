Venson, then a dentist on Beale Street, took his wife's nephew to view the Cotton Carnival Parade. When his nephew pointed out that . . . the Negroes were horses, Dr. Venson decided to request that Negroes be allowed to participate fully in the parade.

	This typed petition, stamped by the Tennessee Anti-Suffrage Association, enumerates the reasons for their opposition to women`s suffrage. Stating their resentment at having "Votes for Women" thrust upon them, they declare that the vote will draw women into the evil of politics and degrade their sex. They believe that women cannot effect any reform without the approval of men, and trust their fathers, brothers and sons to act in their best interest. They also claim that women are better protected in states without woman suffrage, and that giving women the franchise would increase taxation.

	This newspaper clipping, likely the Nashville Banner, is of a warning from the anti-suffragists to those who have accused them of being paid by "liquor interests." It emphatically refutes any connection to or payment from liquor interests, and claims that Susan B. Anthony herself had appealed to the United States Brewers` Association. The message threatens legal action against libel or slander, and lists the names of Judge John R. Tyson and Hon. Everett P. Wheeler as the general counsel to the Southern Women`s League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment and the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage, respectively.

	This two-sided broadside contains the reprint, originally published in both the Nashville Banner and the Chattanooga Times, of an editorial and an article attacking Carrie Chapman Catt. One side contains an letter to Mrs. Catt from Mrs. James S. Pinkard, President of the Southern Women`s League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. Pinkard asks Catt to explain what she meant by statements such as "American women and men, white and black, should share equally in the privileges of democracy." She states that Tennessee legislators would violate their oaths if they vote to ratify the suffrage amendment, and demands the truth in this matter of "life and death" for the South. The other side reprints an article from The Woman Patriot, an anti-suffrage publication, which asserts that Catt defamed the United States by decrying the treatment of women with claims such as the fact that women cannot vote while aliens, illiterates, drunkards, paupers, criminals and the feeble-minded can vote.

	This two-sided broadside, compiled by the Southern Women`s League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, presents race-based arguments against the ratification of the 19th Amendment. One side reprints resolutions of the National Association of Colored Women`s Clubs from their convention in Tuskegee, Alabama in June, 1920. The other side warns of the possible passage of three Force Bills designed to force states to enforce the 14th Amendment along with the 19th Amendment, should the latter pass. It states that these bills would reverse the trend of the previous thirty years, in which 14th and 15th Amendments had been allowed to "rest lightly" upon the South. It claims that Southern manhood will defend Anglo-Saxon civilization and reject the Force bills to avoid reopening the wounds of Reconstruction.

	This broadside proclaims that the 19th Amendment will never be ratified if Tennesseans guard their rights. It emphatically states that the Tennessee constitution probihits the ratification of any federal amendment until a new legislature is elected. It further claims that only the United States Supreme Court can declare that the Tennessee constitution is in conflict with the U.S. Constitution. Those who try to circumvent this provision are accused of being lawbreakers who should be impeached, and who are no better than the "BOOTLEGGER and the BOLSHEVIST." The message urges citizens to fight the suffragists attempts to override the Tennessee constitution by organizing mass meetings and circulating petitions.

	This humorous anti-suffrage broadside makes claims such as "a vote for federal suffrage is a vote for female nagging forever." Woman suffrage masculinize women and feminize men, leading to a collapse of male ascendency, causing the degeneration of the nation. There is an effective political cartoon showing a hen with a "Votes for Women" sash leaving her eggs behind, telling the rooster to "set on them yourself, old man, my country calls me."

	This broadside, published by anti-suffrage forces in Nashville during the struggle for the ratification of the 19th Amendment, details racial reasons for their opposition to women`s suffrage. It claims that women`s suffrage must be defeated for the sake of Southern civilization, womanhood, and both the white and black races. It lauds the racial harmony of the South, and warns that giving women the right to vote will only spark political competition between the sexes and between the races. There is a detailed accounting of the population of southern states, broken down by race and sex, showing a white majority in all states except South Carolina and Mississippi. An enumerated list of facts purports that the 19th Amendment will create a Negro majority in South Carolina and Mississippi, where no such "real majority" exists now. The amendment will also create a Negro majority in over 200 counties in the South.

	This broadside, published by some unattributed opponent of women`s suffrage, warns Southern men of the threat to states` rights if women attain the right to vote. It states that woman suffrage will reopen the question of Negro suffrage and bring another wave of female carpetbaggers. It contains excerpts from "The Negro and the New Social Order," which had been printed in The Messenger, published by A. Phillip Randolph as the "only radical Negro magazine in America."

	Written by a Nashville physician and suffrage opponent after the National American Woman Suffrage Association met in Nashville in 1914, this anti-suffrage pamphlet contains Lyon`s opinions of the suffragettes and his rationalization for limited suffrage and political involvement for women. Among his arguments against woman suffrage are assertions that many women will only vote as men tell them and that universal suffrage will "enfranchies four or five million negresses."

	This booklet enumerates the items for which the Tennessee League of Women Voters asked the legislature to support in the interest of women and children. Among the issues are the civil status of women, including property rights of married women; education - including minimum 9 months school terms, minimun salaries and competency requirements for teachers, mandatory physical education, free kindergarten, and the establishment of a vocational school for black girls; women in industry - establishment of a minimum wage and a Department of Labor, the abolishment of the convict lease system, improvement in working hours and conditions for working women, and equal pay for equal work; and additional items related to child welfare, social hygiene, temperance and conservation.

	This article from The Woman Citizen describes the celebrations in Washington, D.C. and New York City that followed the ratification of the 19th Amendment. It contains quotations from various suffragists who worked for ratification in Tennessee. It appears to be the conclusion of a series by Marjorie Shuler, but there is no byline to confirm her authorship.

	This article describes the final phase of the struggle for women`s suffrage, outlining the unsuccessful injunction against ratification in Tennessee, as well as the celebration in Washington following the official federal ratification. It names many of the women, such as Carrie Chapman Catt and Anne Dallas Dudley, who worked in Tennessee for the ratification of the 19th Amendment. The article contains two maps of the United States. The first is "The Suffrage Map in Early August, 1920," showing states which allowed women full suffrage, limited suffrage such as for primaries, or presidential or municipal elections, or no suffrage at all. The second shows "What Tennessee Did to the Suffrage Map," which was to grant full suffrage throughout the country.

	This editorial, from The Woman Citizen, describes the potential for abuse in the use of judicial injunctions. The author, listed only as A.S.B., claims that one "insignificant judge seeks to over-rule the Governor, a majority of the State Legislature and even the Secretary of State of the United States" and states that suffragists are "filled with indignation and disgust."

	This press release contains a 2 page statement by Carrie Chapman Catt about the machinations of the anti-suffragists to derail the ratification of the 19th Amendment by the Tennessee legislature.

The testimonials also conflate the singers` performance with supporting emancipation and restitution of former slaves. The final page of the program lists the chartered institutions of the American Missionary Association, including Fisk University. Additional programs for concerts in 1874 in Birmingham and Cambridge are also included in the collection, as well as a similar program for a concert in Germany in 1877.

The singers first toured the North in 1871, and then toured Britain in 1873 as a part of their fundraising efforts. Their second tour in 1875 began in Britain, then moved on to Germany and ended in 1878 when the group disbanded. A new choir was formed in 1879 and toured internationally in the 1880s. This document has faint markings which may be the signature of the ticket holder, or a note.

	1 tif. A ticket for a concert of the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University in Scotland.

	4 tifs. A biographical sketch including a photograph in the Fisk University News of Mrs. Ella Sheppard Moore, a graduate and singer with the Jubilee Singers. Sheppard was the daughter of a slave who purchased his own freedom. She was trained in music in Cincinnati, while her father tried to escape re-enslavement. Ella studied at Fisk University for two years, and then taught at the college. She was a member of the Jubilee Singers who toured Europe and America. Later in her life she worked with her husband, Reverend George W. Moore, and gave lectures. The sketch also re-prints her writings about the Jubilee Singers. There are also three eulogies written in her praise in the paper, written by Talley and Moore.

	3 tifs. A three page brochure issued at an event where Fisk college raised the flag over Jubilee Hall on September 22, 1915. The flag raising and speech was to "mark the opening of the New Year and the Anniversary of the Preliminary Announcement by Lincoln of the Freeing of the Slave, September 22, 1862." The page was signed by Dr. F.A. Mc Kenzie. The first page features a black and white image of one of the college`s buildings flying a flag and featuring a tall tree in front. The second page is in praise of the flag and its symbolism, with two images of the college. The page reads in part, "The Flag represents in its aspects of patriotism, of national devotion, two great ideas, two great facts. The first great idea, the first great fact, is that of Obedience. . . . The second great idea, the second great fact, is that of Perfection. . . . When we are true to our flag we are true to that kingdom whose law is, Be ye therefore perfect." The third page text aligns Lincoln with the flag, stating "The flag of Lincoln is the flag of the South, and the flag of the North, the flag of the white and the flag of the black. It is the flag under whose folds no slave can breathe. . . . The flag and freedom and education are inseparable."

	7 tifs. The front pages and table of contents of a book printed in Great Britain during the tour by the Jubilee Singers. The Jubilee Singers were created when George White, professor of music, decide to take a nine-member choral ensemble on the road to generate funds for the University. The group left on October 6, 1871, which is now a holiday for the University. In 1872 they sang at the World Peace festival in Boston and for President Ulysses S. Grant. In 1873 eleven members of the group toured Europe and generated funds for the school`s first permanent building, Jubilee Hall. The images are numbered with their contents. 1: The cover. Reading: "The Singing Campaign for Ten Thousand Pounds or the Jubilee Singers in Great Britain." The cover is dark blue with gold text and features a harp and scroll symbol in the center. 2: An illustration of the Jubilee Singers. The names read: E. Watkins. I.P. Dickerson. B.M. Holmes. T. Rutling. Georgie Gordon. Mabel Lewis. Maggie Porter. Jennie Jackson. Ella Sheppard. Julia Jackson. Minnie Tate. 3: The Jubilee Singers, and their Campaign for Twenty Thousand Dollars. By the Rev. G.D. Pike B.A., District Secretary of the American Missionary Association. Twenty-seventh Thousand. London. Hodder and Stoughton. Boston, U.S.A: Lee and Shepard. 1874. 4: Advertisement to the English Edition. The visit of the Jubilee Singers to England has necessitated a new Edition of this work, the American Edition of which has attained a circulation of nearly ten thousand copies in three months. The book contains a history of the first singing tour, but a year has since elapsed, during which, such increasing success has attended the efforts of the Singers, that they have been encouraged to appeal to the English public for aid in the accomplishment of their mission. The Jubilee Hall of Fisk University (a cut of which forms the frontispiece) is already partly erected, and funds are now required to complete the building. 27, Paternoster Row, May, 1873. 5: Preface. The following pages were prepared at intervals during the summer vacation, for the purpose of answering numerous questions about the Jubilee Singers. The statements respecting the illiteracy of the South, the campaign for Twenty Thousand Dollars, the Fisk University, and the American Missionary Association, are reliable. The personal histories were gathered chiefly by a former teacher of Fisk University, who has rendered me great service in preparing this volume for the press in season for our coming campaign for the further endowment of that institution. That the reader may be inspired with a noble enthusiasm to repair the damages done by Slavery, and to restore fourfold to a race that has been wronged, is the most earnest wish of the author. G.D.P.
